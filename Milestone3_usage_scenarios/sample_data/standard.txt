WEEK_TEXT:
[Mon – meeting notes]
- Weekly sync with product team.
- PM walked through the new onboarding flow.
- I mostly listened. Had a question about the timeline but did not speak up.
- Action item: send updated draft of spec by Thursday.

[Mon – Slack DM with coworker]
"Today’s sync ran long again lol. I had something to say but the moment passed. Maybe next time."

[Tue – personal note]
Felt pretty scattered today. Jumped between tickets and did not get a full block of focus time. I am also a bit worried about the Friday demo, but no one else seems stressed, so maybe I am overthinking it.

[Wed – meeting notes]
- 1:1 with manager.
- Talked about my progress on the spec and how I am ramping up.
- Manager said the work looks good and encouraged me to share more in group settings.

[Wed – reflection]
It was reassuring to hear that I am on track. Still, I freeze a bit when the whole team is in the room. I keep rehearsing what I want to say instead of just saying it.

[Thu – Slack channel #team]
"Sharing an early version of the spec here. Feedback welcome!"

[Thu – personal note]
Posting the spec link felt like a small step. Tiny spike of anxiety when I hit send, but people were kind and gave constructive comments.

[Fri – demo notes]
- Internal demo of new onboarding flow.
- PM and designer did most of the talking.
- I answered one question about an edge case, voice was slightly shaky but I survived.

[Fri – end-of-week reflection]
Overall, I think I took one or two small steps toward speaking up more, but I still feel like I am hiding a bit. Energy level is medium-low. Not completely burnt out, but definitely ready for the weekend.
