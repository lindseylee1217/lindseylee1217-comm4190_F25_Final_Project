current_goal_description: experiment with intense emotional dialogue

WEEK_TEXT:
Vignette — Draft confrontation scene:
“I begged you!” Mara screamed, fists shaking. “I begged you not to leave me there!”
Jonas didn’t move. His silence was its own cruelty—precise, practiced.
“I waited in that freezing corridor for hours,” she said, voice cracking. “Do you know what it feels like to have hope ripped out one thread at a time?”

Character note:
Mara’s emotion here is fear turning into rage. She *believes* Jonas abandoned her, but in the backstory he was unconscious, not uncaring.

Side writing:
I don’t actually feel this angry—just testing how far I can push her emotional range. I want the scene to feel breathless without being melodramatic.

Imagery card:
“A doorframe lit from behind, two shadows stretching away like severed strings.”

Writing diary:
Mostly trying to understand what Mara is terrified *of*, and how her fear might mask a deeper grief. None of this is personal; just exploring extremes.

Imagery tags: rupture, abandoned spaces, raised voices
