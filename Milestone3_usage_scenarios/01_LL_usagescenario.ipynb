    "The user will open the app. LLM chatbot opens up on the side of the screen, prompting user to give their preference of LLM style and tone (peppy, laidback, etc)--done at first use of Looking Glass and is changeable thereafter. User then either uploads or directly types a new journal entry into the journal interface. After the user saves a new entry, the LLM then runs an inline textual analysis of the user's tone in writing, and generates a reflective output including: (1) detected emotions with confidence scores, (2) summary of journal entry, and (3) theme of the entry. LLM then prompts user with checkboxes to: (1) engage in talk therapy, (2) set goals, (3) compare most recent journal entry to previously uploaded entries, and (4) display trajectories of emotions or goals. User can select to compare most recent journal entry to previously uploaded entries or display trajectories of emotions to reflect on their personal growth over time. If user had set a goal, they can also track their growth on their goal based on (1) LLM analysis of journal entry, and (2) LLM prompts of user's level of attainment of goal.\n"

    "chat_with_looking_glass('''I have three journal entries from different periods of time:\n",
    "Journal entry #1: Freshman year\n",
    "I’ve only been on campus for a few weeks, and everything still feels unreal. I walk across the quad and see people laughing, heading to class in big groups like they’ve known each other forever. Meanwhile, I’m still trying to figure out which dining hall has edible food and how the bus system works. There are moments when I feel like I’m hovering outside of my own life, watching everyone else settle into college while I’m stuck trying to catch up.\n",
    "\n",
    "I keep telling myself that it’s normal to feel overwhelmed—after all, I moved away from home, left behind the friends I’ve had for years, and jumped into an environment where nobody knows me. Still, I can’t help but feel scared that maybe I don’t belong here or that everyone else has this unspoken “college playbook” that I somehow missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "But even with the nerves and awkward moments, I’m trying. I signed up for a few clubs, even though I felt my voice shake when introducing myself. I made myself sit with new people in the dining hall instead of eating alone in my dorm. I even talked to my RA about getting more involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don’t fit in yet—but I don’t think I’m supposed to instantly. I’m learning that figuring things out takes time. Maybe college isn’t about arriving fully confident; maybe it’s about becoming someone braver along the way. I’m scared, but I’m here. And I’m willing to try my best.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Journal entry #2: Sophomore year:\n",
    "It’s funny how different this year feels. Last fall, I couldn’t imagine finding “my people,” but somehow, I did. It started with one girl from my biology lab inviting me to study with her, and suddenly that turned into game nights, late-night walks for boba, and group chats that never stop buzzing. I feel grounded in a way I didn’t last year. I laugh more. I show up fully as myself. I feel seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "But now that I feel more comfortable socially, a new anxiety has crept in—my future. Everyone around me seems to be mapping out their careers already: internships, research labs, networking events. People keep asking me what I want to do after graduation, and every time, I feel a jolt in my stomach. I *should* know by now, right? Sophomore year is when you’re supposed to start forming a plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve been bouncing between majors, career paths, and “what ifs,” trying to make decisions that feel too big for me right now. What if I pick wrong? What if I disappoint myself?\n",
    "\n",
    "My friends are supportive—they remind me that nobody has it all figured out—but I still feel like I’m walking on a tightrope stretched toward an invisible future.\n",
    "\n",
    "I love where I am socially. I’m grateful for the people I’ve found. But I wish I could enjoy the present without this constant ticking clock in the back of my mind. Maybe the answer will come if I just keep moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Journal entry #3: Junior year\n",
    "This semester feels like a breath of fresh air in a way I didn’t expect. After months of worrying, stressing, and second-guessing myself, I actually landed a summer internship—one that I’m genuinely excited about. It’s like a weight lifted off my shoulders. For the first time in a long time, the future doesn’t feel like a looming pressure. It feels… possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe that’s why I’ve been savoring the little things more. My friends and I have been planning weekend trips, study picnics, and movie nights in the dorm lounge. Instead of obsessively checking internship portals, I’m spending evenings laughing with the people who have become family. Junior year feels steadier, like I’m finally balancing academics, friendships, and my own expectations without constantly feeling like I’m falling behind.\n",
    "\n",
    "I catch myself appreciating moments I would’ve rushed through before: walking to class with a coffee in hand, sitting under the campus oak trees, or listening to music with my roommate while we get ready. There’s a joy in simply being here, in this chapter, surrounded by people I care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, I know I’ll probably worry again—because that’s who I am—but right now, I’m letting myself enjoy this calm. I’m proud of how far I’ve come since freshman year, terrified and unsure. Now I feel capable. Prepared. And excited to spend the rest of the year making memories I know I’ll hold onto long after college ends.''')"

    "This semester feels like a breath of fresh air in a way I didn’t expect. After months of worrying, stressing, and second-guessing myself, I actually landed a summer internship—one that I’m genuinely excited about. It’s like a weight lifted off my shoulders. For the first time in a long time, the future doesn’t feel like a looming pressure. It feels… possible.\n",
    "Maybe that’s why I’ve been savoring the little things more. My friends and I have been planning weekend trips, study picnics, and movie nights in the dorm lounge. Instead of obsessively checking internship portals, I’m spending evenings laughing with the people who have become family. Junior year feels steadier, like I’m finally balancing academics, friendships, and my own expectations without constantly feeling like I’m falling behind.\n",
    "I catch myself appreciating moments I would’ve rushed through before: walking to class with a coffee in hand, sitting under the campus oak trees, or listening to music with my roommate while we get ready. There’s a joy in simply being here, in this chapter, surrounded by people I care about.\n",
    "Of course, I know I’ll probably worry again—because that’s who I am—but right now, I’m letting myself enjoy this calm. I’m proud of how far I’ve come since freshman year, terrified and unsure. Now I feel capable. Prepared. And excited to spend the rest of the year making memories I know I’ll hold onto long after college ends.''')"
