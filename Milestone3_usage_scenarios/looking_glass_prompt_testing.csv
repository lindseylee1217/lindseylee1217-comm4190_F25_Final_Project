They experienced moments of hesitation, such as during the Monday sync where they had a question but did not voice it. Despite this, there were small steps forward, like sharing the spec in the team Slack channel and answering a question during the Friday demo, even though it caused some anxiety. The user received positive feedback from their manager, which was reassuring, yet they still feel a bit apprehensive in group settings. Energy levels were medium-low by the end of the week, indicating some fatigue but not burnout.
