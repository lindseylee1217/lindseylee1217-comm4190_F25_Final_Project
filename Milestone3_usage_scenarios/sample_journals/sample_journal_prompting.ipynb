    "Give me a 3 sample journal entries that are 250 word each that would follow this concept: A college student write three different journals each year in college. She is currently a junior. Here are some specific instructions for each journal entry: 1. journal entry 1 focuses on her in her freshman year feeling scared and orienting herself to college. Feeling that she doesn't fit in yet but is willing to try her best. 2. Journal entry 2 focuses on her in her sophomore year and finding a group of people and friends that she loves spending time with. But now she's anxious about career choices. 3. Journal entry 3 focuses on her in her junior year, and how she's been feeling like she got a summer internship and is now excited to spend her time creating memories with friends rather than being stressed out about career choices.\n",

    "\n",
    "I’ve only been on campus for a few weeks, and everything still feels unreal. I walk across the quad and see people laughing, heading to class in big groups like they’ve known each other forever. Meanwhile, I’m still trying to figure out which dining hall has edible food and how the bus system works. There are moments when I feel like I’m hovering outside of my own life, watching everyone else settle into college while I’m stuck trying to catch up.\n",
    "\n",
    "I keep telling myself that it’s normal to feel overwhelmed—after all, I moved away from home, left behind the friends I’ve had for years, and jumped into an environment where nobody knows me. Still, I can’t help but feel scared that maybe I don’t belong here or that everyone else has this unspoken “college playbook” that I somehow missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "But even with the nerves and awkward moments, I’m trying. I signed up for a few clubs, even though I felt my voice shake when introducing myself. I made myself sit with new people in the dining hall instead of eating alone in my dorm. I even talked to my RA about getting more involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don’t fit in yet—but I don’t think I’m supposed to instantly. I’m learning that figuring things out takes time. Maybe college isn’t about arriving fully confident; maybe it’s about becoming someone braver along the way. I’m scared, but I’m here. And I’m willing to try my best.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Journal Entry 2 — Sophomore Year (≈250 words)**\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s funny how different this year feels. Last fall, I couldn’t imagine finding “my people,” but somehow, I did. It started with one girl from my biology lab inviting me to study with her, and suddenly that turned into game nights, late-night walks for boba, and group chats that never stop buzzing. I feel grounded in a way I didn’t last year. I laugh more. I show up fully as myself. I feel seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "But now that I feel more comfortable socially, a new anxiety has crept in—my future. Everyone around me seems to be mapping out their careers already: internships, research labs, networking events. People keep asking me what I want to do after graduation, and every time, I feel a jolt in my stomach. I *should* know by now, right? Sophomore year is when you’re supposed to start forming a plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve been bouncing between majors, career paths, and “what ifs,” trying to make decisions that feel too big for me right now. What if I pick wrong? What if I disappoint myself?\n",
    "\n",
    "My friends are supportive—they remind me that nobody has it all figured out—but I still feel like I’m walking on a tightrope stretched toward an invisible future.\n",
    "\n",
    "I love where I am socially. I’m grateful for the people I’ve found. But I wish I could enjoy the present without this constant ticking clock in the back of my mind. Maybe the answer will come if I just keep moving forward.\n",

    "This semester feels like a breath of fresh air in a way I didn’t expect. After months of worrying, stressing, and second-guessing myself, I actually landed a summer internship—one that I’m genuinely excited about. It’s like a weight lifted off my shoulders. For the first time in a long time, the future doesn’t feel like a looming pressure. It feels… possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe that’s why I’ve been savoring the little things more. My friends and I have been planning weekend trips, study picnics, and movie nights in the dorm lounge. Instead of obsessively checking internship portals, I’m spending evenings laughing with the people who have become family. Junior year feels steadier, like I’m finally balancing academics, friendships, and my own expectations without constantly feeling like I’m falling behind.\n",
    "\n",
    "I catch myself appreciating moments I would’ve rushed through before: walking to class with a coffee in hand, sitting under the campus oak trees, or listening to music with my roommate while we get ready. There’s a joy in simply being here, in this chapter, surrounded by people I care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, I know I’ll probably worry again—because that’s who I am—but right now, I’m letting myself enjoy this calm. I’m proud of how far I’ve come since freshman year, terrified and unsure. Now I feel capable. Prepared. And excited to spend the rest of the year making memories I know I’ll hold onto long after college ends.\n",

    "I’m still trying to sort through everything that happened last night. I keep replaying the moment I realized Jenna was gone. One minute we were together, weaving through a crowded living room at that off-campus party, and the next I turned around and she had completely disappeared. At first I thought maybe she went to the bathroom or stepped outside for air, but after fifteen minutes passed, my stomach started twisting. I felt stupid for panicking, but also… wasn’t she supposed to be the one looking out for me? I’m still new to this campus, new to the whole party scene, and I thought she understood that.\n",

Instead, I pulled her aside and told her how scared I’d been, but she brushed it off, saying I was “overreacting.” Hearing that stung more than I expected. It made me feel small, like my safety and feelings were just inconveniences.\n",

    "All day today I’ve been bouncing between frustration and guilt. Part of me wonders if I really *was* overreacting, but another part of me knows that being left alone in a chaotic place—especially as a freshman girl who doesn’t really know anyone—is legitimately frightening. I just wish she understood that. I don’t want this to turn into some big drama, but I also don’t want to pretend it didn’t hurt.\n",
