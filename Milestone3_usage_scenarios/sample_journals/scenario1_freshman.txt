I’ve only been on campus for a few weeks, and everything still feels unreal. I walk across the quad and see people laughing, heading to class in big groups like they’ve known each other forever. Meanwhile, I’m still trying to figure out which dining hall has edible food and how the bus system works. There are moments when I feel like I’m hovering outside of my own life, watching everyone else settle into college while I’m stuck trying to catch up.

I keep telling myself that it’s normal to feel overwhelmed—after all, I moved away from home, left behind the friends I’ve had for years, and jumped into an environment where nobody knows me. Still, I can’t help but feel scared that maybe I don’t belong here or that everyone else has this unspoken “college playbook” that I somehow missed.

But even with the nerves and awkward moments, I’m trying. I signed up for a few clubs, even though I felt my voice shake when introducing myself. I made myself sit with new people in the dining hall instead of eating alone in my dorm. I even talked to my RA about getting more involved.

I don’t fit in yet—but I don’t think I’m supposed to instantly. I’m learning that figuring things out takes time. Maybe college isn’t about arriving fully confident; maybe it’s about becoming someone braver along the way. I’m scared, but I’m here. And I’m willing to try my best.
