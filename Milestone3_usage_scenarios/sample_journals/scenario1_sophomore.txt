It’s funny how different this year feels. Last fall, I couldn’t imagine finding “my people,” but somehow, I did. It started with one girl from my biology lab inviting me to study with her, and suddenly that turned into game nights, late-night walks for boba, and group chats that never stop buzzing. I feel grounded in a way I didn’t last year. I laugh more. I show up fully as myself. I feel seen.

But now that I feel more comfortable socially, a new anxiety has crept in—my future. Everyone around me seems to be mapping out their careers already: internships, research labs, networking events. People keep asking me what I want to do after graduation, and every time, I feel a jolt in my stomach. I *should* know by now, right? Sophomore year is when you’re supposed to start forming a plan.

I’ve been bouncing between majors, career paths, and “what ifs,” trying to make decisions that feel too big for me right now. What if I pick wrong? What if I disappoint myself?

My friends are supportive—they remind me that nobody has it all figured out—but I still feel like I’m walking on a tightrope stretched toward an invisible future.

I love where I am socially. I’m grateful for the people I’ve found. But I wish I could enjoy the present without this constant ticking clock in the back of my mind. Maybe the answer will come if I just keep moving forward.
