I’m still trying to sort through everything that happened last night. I keep replaying the moment I realized Jenna was gone. One minute we were together, weaving through a crowded living room at that off-campus party, and the next I turned around and she had completely disappeared. At first I thought maybe she went to the bathroom or stepped outside for air, but after fifteen minutes passed, my stomach started twisting. I felt stupid for panicking, but also… wasn’t she supposed to be the one looking out for me? I’m still new to this campus, new to the whole party scene, and I thought she understood that.

When I finally found her—laughing in the kitchen with people I didn’t even know—I felt this weird mix of relief and anger rush through me. I wanted to yell and cry and leave all at once. Instead, I pulled her aside and told her how scared I’d been, but she brushed it off, saying I was “overreacting.” Hearing that stung more than I expected. It made me feel small, like my safety and feelings were just inconveniences.

All day today I’ve been bouncing between frustration and guilt. Part of me wonders if I really *was* overreacting, but another part of me knows that being left alone in a chaotic place—especially as a freshman girl who doesn’t really know anyone—is legitimately frightening. I just wish she understood that. I don’t want this to turn into some big drama, but I also don’t want to pretend it didn’t hurt.

I hope we can talk again when we’re both calmer. I miss feeling like I could trust her.
