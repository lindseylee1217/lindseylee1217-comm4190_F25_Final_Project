This semester feels like a breath of fresh air in a way I didn’t expect. After months of worrying, stressing, and second-guessing myself, I actually landed a summer internship—one that I’m genuinely excited about. It’s like a weight lifted off my shoulders. For the first time in a long time, the future doesn’t feel like a looming pressure. It feels… possible.

Maybe that’s why I’ve been savoring the little things more. My friends and I have been planning weekend trips, study picnics, and movie nights in the dorm lounge. Instead of obsessively checking internship portals, I’m spending evenings laughing with the people who have become family. Junior year feels steadier, like I’m finally balancing academics, friendships, and my own expectations without constantly feeling like I’m falling behind.

I catch myself appreciating moments I would’ve rushed through before: walking to class with a coffee in hand, sitting under the campus oak trees, or listening to music with my roommate while we get ready. There’s a joy in simply being here, in this chapter, surrounded by people I care about.

Of course, I know I’ll probably worry again—because that’s who I am—but right now, I’m letting myself enjoy this calm. I’m proud of how far I’ve come since freshman year, terrified and unsure. Now I feel capable. Prepared. And excited to spend the rest of the year making memories I know I’ll hold onto long after college ends.
