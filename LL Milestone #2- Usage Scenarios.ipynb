The LLM will build up a list of names from these chats and ask follow up questions about them. In the background the app is constructing an ego network where nodes are the names of the friends (with attributes for features like how long you've known them, how strong the relationship is, what the individual likes/dislikes, how often you see them etc) and edges between the nodes based on imputing relationships like \"A knows B\", \"A socializes with C\" etc. from the chat history'\n",

LLM then prompts user with checkboxes to: (1) engage in talk therapy, (2) set goals, (3) compare most recent journal entry to previously uploaded entries, and (4) display trajectories of emotions or goals. User can select to compare most recent journal entry to previously uploaded entries or display trajectories of emotions to reflect on their personal growth over time. If user had set a goal, they can also track their growth on their goal based on (1) LLM analysis of journal entry, and (2) LLM prompts of user's level of attainment of goal.\n",
