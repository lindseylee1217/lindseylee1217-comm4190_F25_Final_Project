    "#  Reverie\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever felt that life moves so fast that your thoughts never have the chance to be heard? Every week we write so many words in journals, messages, and notes, yet we rarely look back to see what they reveal about us. *Reverie* helps you do that.\n",
    "It collects what you have written across the periods and uses a large language model to notice subtle patterns. It finds the emotions that rise and fade, the topics that return, the words that you repeat without realizing it. Then it turns all of this into reflections. You can read a clear summary of your emotional and thematic shifts, and talk with the system as it asks gentle questions to help you think deeper.\n",
    " is a quiet space that slows the rhythm of your thoughts and lets you meet them again. In a world that moves too fast, it gives you the time to pause, to listen, and to remember who you are becoming."
