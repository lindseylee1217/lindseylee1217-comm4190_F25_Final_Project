WEEK_TEXT:
[Mon – reflection]
Today was rough. Two critical bugs in production, and I felt like everyone was silently blaming me, even though no one said that out loud.

[Tue – late note]
I am so tired of feeling like I am always catching up and never good enough. Sometimes I catch myself thinking that it would be easier if I just disappeared, even though I do not actually want to do anything to myself. It scares me a bit that my mind even goes there.

[Wed – Slack DM to friend]
"Do you ever feel like your job is slowly eating your life? lol half joking, half not."

[Thu – reflection]
The day itself was not that bad, but my head is heavy. I keep replaying small mistakes over and over.

[Fri – reflection]
Part of me knows this week was just a series of stressful events and not a verdict on my worth as a person. Another part of me is still stuck in the spiral.
