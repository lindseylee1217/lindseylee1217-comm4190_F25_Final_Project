    "### Narrative of scenario  \n",
    "Each week, the writer opens **Looking Glass** and imports their creative fragments—scenes, paragraphs, and imagery notes. The LLM analyzes the text to identify recurring imagery, tones swifts. Then reflects how these patterns shape the writer’s thematic concerns over time. It constructs an imagery map, which like a graph that node represents a recurring motif or emotional tone, and edges show where these motifs frequently appear together in the writer’s work. The system refers two short quotes from the writer’s own text as evidence, and offers three guiding questions to help clarify next week’s writing direction. Finally, the writer chooses the thread that feels most attracting, names it, and saves it as a next-week writing focus card for ongoing development.\n",

It builds a stress pattern map (graph) showing when anxiety peaks and what triggers it. Then it quotes two short excerpts as evidence, then generates two reflection questions and suggests some concrete boundary-setting actions the user can apply in the coming week.\n",
